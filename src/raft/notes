log is atleast as up-to-date as receiverâ€™s log, grant vote
Raft determines which of two logs is more up-to-date by comparing the index and term of
the last entries in the logs. If the logs have last entries with different terms,
then the log with the later term is more up-to-date. If the logs end with the same term,
then whichever log is longer is more up-to-date.
